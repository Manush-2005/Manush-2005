Hi there !

I'm a passionate second-year Computer Engineering undergrad, diving deep into Machine Learning with Python . I'm particularly fascinated by its potential to enhance web development   (think cool and intelligent websites!).

My Projects:

Buys E-commerce (MERN Stack): Built a full-fledged e-commerce platform using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (Link to Repo: link to your repo) !
GitHub Explorer (GitHub API): Developed a tool to explore the vast world of GitHub using the official APIs (Link to Repo: link to your repo)!
Bitcoin Price Predictor (ML & MERN Stack): Combined Machine Learning with the MERN stack to create a website that predicts Bitcoin prices (work in progress!) (Link to Repo: link to your repo) (if applicable)
Skills:

Programming Languages: JavaScript (primary) , Python
Web Development: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Ô∏è
Machine Learning: Exploring algorithms and applications
Always learning, always building!  Feel free to reach out or explore my code!   Link to your website or portfolio: link to your website (optional)

P.S. Check out some of the cool things I'm learning and working on in my repositories  !
